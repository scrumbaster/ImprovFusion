Whether you're a music lover or an experienced data scientist, this project has something for you. The project applies the concepts found in natural language generation and Markov chains to generate an improvised version of a musical arrangement. The application is capable of generating an improvisation of any length and of set similarity to the original piece, fusing several different arrangements in its improvisation, and providing an interactive and detailed visualization of the pathways of note transitions.
